<h1>A32i Country Report: Haiti</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Government Readiness & AI Vision</h2><p>Haiti is beginning to explore AI as a tool for long-term national resilience and international development partnerships. While infrastructure remains a key challenge, Haiti’s leadership has expressed openness to innovation. As former Prime Minister Ariel Henry stated, “Digital transformation is a necessary step toward our national recovery.” The government has taken steps to modernize governance systems through partnerships with the UN and regional tech hubs, signaling potential for AI-based progress.

Haiti's primary technical partnerships include collaborations with the Caribbean Telecommunications Union (CTU) and support from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). These organizations have provided strategic frameworks for national digital transformation, including AI readiness assessment tools and digital identity systems.

The country's 2024–2026 Digital Transformation Roadmap includes provisions for AI development, cybersecurity infrastructure, and e-government portals, supported by an annual ICT budget of approximately $38 million. Much of this funding is allocated to infrastructure, education, and systems automation—laying the groundwork for AI integration.

Public statements from Haiti’s Ministry of Public Works and the National Telecommunications Council (CONATEL) have emphasized the role of AI in strengthening public service delivery, disaster preparedness, and digital inclusion initiatives.</p><h2>Projected Financial Impact of 30% A32i Integration</h2>
