        <div class="section">
            <h2>Government Readiness & AI Vision</h2>
            <p>
                Haiti is beginning to explore AI as a tool for long-term national resilience and international development partnerships. While infrastructure remains a key challenge, Haiti’s leadership has expressed openness to innovation. As former Prime Minister Ariel Henry stated, “Digital transformation is a necessary step toward national recovery.” The government has taken steps to modernize governance systems through partnerships with the UN and regional tech hubs, signaling potential for AI-based progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Haiti’s primary technical partnerships include collaborations with the Caribbean Telecommunications Union (CTU) and support from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). These organizations have provided strategic frameworks for national digital transformation, including AI readiness assessment tools and digital identity systems. The 2024–2026 Digital Transformation Roadmap includes provisions for AI development, cybersecurity infrastructure, education, and systems automation—laying the groundwork for AI integration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Haiti’s national ICT budget is estimated at $52 million USD (2025), or roughly 3% of the national budget. Public statements from the Ministry of Public Works and the National Telecommunications Council (CONATEL) have emphasized the role of AI in strengthening public service delivery, disaster preparedness, and digital inclusion initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Minister of National Education Nesmy Manigat stated, “AI can be a powerful tool for democratizing access to quality education and workforce training.” The government has begun piloting digital platforms for curriculum planning and predictive analytics in school infrastructure development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, President Jovenel Moïse had previously proposed the creation of a National Digital Agency and the expansion of broadband infrastructure—key prerequisites for any AI-integrated governance system. International partnerships with Canada and Taiwan have helped fund smart infrastructure projects, including fiber optic expansion and mobile tech for rural areas.
