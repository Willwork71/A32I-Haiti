  <h1>A32i Country Report: Haiti</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Government Readiness</h2>
    <p>
      Haiti is beginning to explore AI as a tool for long-term national resilience and international development partnerships.
      While infrastructure remains a key challenge, Haiti’s leadership has expressed openness to innovation. As former Prime Minister Ariel Henry stated,
      “Digital transformation is a necessary step toward our national recovery.” The government has taken steps to modernize governance systems
      through partnerships with the UN and regional tech hubs, signaling potential for AI-based progress.

    <h2>Projected Financial Impact</h2>
    <p>
      With 30% integration, A32i systems could deliver $240–$320 million in annual value for Haiti—representing up to 18.8% of total government spending.
      Primary benefits include $120M in smart public budgeting, $80M in sustainable food systems, and $60M in targeted social programs.
      With modest setup costs and foundational tech already underway, ROI could be achieved in under 30 months.
